1) How to check that the JSON w3 object doesn't have any errors in it.  When running a file with errors the object is:
Validator Output:
{
  "messages":[
    {
      "type":"error",
      .........
     ........... 
    },
    {
      "type":"error",
      "......
      .....
    }
  ]
}
Just need to detect one error and then not proceed with code.

2) Merge with current autograder so that we can ensure that our html object is the same that is created by grader.  Currently reading from
our own file, need to switch to the value of POST.

3) Test it out.
